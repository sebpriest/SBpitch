# To Note:
This is a fork of [FCrSTATS](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/)' R Package [SBpitch](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/SBpitch/).

I took [FCrSTATS](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/)' code and made a few adjustments to fit my own needs.

# My Adjustments

From working through FCrSTATS' [tutorials](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/StatsBomb_WomensData) I wanted to incorporate a shot map function to be able to easily reproduce these graphs myself. I called this create_SB_HalfPitch()
